# React.js Flow & Structure

## In HTML
```React is a single page application(SPA) because it only have 1 HTML page with a 'root' div, React is inject in the 'root' div.```

```Also the main.jsx is included here``` 

## In React
```In react main.jsx file, we create a DOM(virtual DOM) and root, then we render our app in that created DOM inside #root div.```

## What is the App used in main.jsx ?
```App is just a component(App.jsx) which contains a App() function, it returns HTML.```

## Create React components
```Note: First letter of the components and functions must be uppercase(Good Practise)```

```Create a component and a function and export it```

```Now import the component to use it```

## Return Multiple Items 
```React function can only return 1 item.```

```To return multiple items or componenets we can use fragment <></> or <div></div>```
